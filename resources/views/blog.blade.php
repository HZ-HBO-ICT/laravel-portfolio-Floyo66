        <div class="box1b2">FEEDBACK</div>
        <div class="box2b2">The feedback i received had alot to do with the way i wrote down my classes. What i did is
            create an hierarchy inside of the stylesheet refering back to the html page. This caused me to create alot of
            unreadable lists consisting of names like "ul li ul li ul. This obviously wasnt the way to go. Jonah also gave
            me some tips on centering my background picture. The problem with this picture was that the picture itself didnt
            fill the entire screen, leaving a white stripe at the bottom. Mr Frans told me that this probably was caused by
            the fact that there wasnt any text shown at the bottom yet so the screen didnt recognize the bottom white stripe
            as a part of the screen yet. I thought this was pretty weird as i chose the fill option. Later Jonah told me
            that it was caused by the size of the image itself and that it could be fixed by zooming inside of the picture.
